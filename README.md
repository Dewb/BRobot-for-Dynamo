# BRobot for Dynamo

A [BRobot](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/BRobot)-based [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/) package for robot control. 

## Setup
If you are not interested in the source code, just do the following:
- Open Dynamo or Dynamo Studio. 
- Create a new workspace.
- At the bottom of the left Library tab, there is an 'Add' dropdown. Choose 'Import library', and point to the 'BRobot-for-Dynamo.dll' file in the repo's 'Sample files' folder. 
- If everything went well, you should see a new 'BRobot-for-Dynamo' package on your Library. Here you will find all the BRobot nodes.

## Tutorials
There are a bunch of Dynamo files in the 'Samples' folder that will help you understand how to setup a project. I will write a dedicated walkthrough section sometime soon.

To understand the meaning of each Action node, please check the [Walkthrough](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/BRobot/blob/master/docs/Walkthrough.md) or [Reference](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/BRobot/blob/master/docs/Reference.md) sections of [BRobot](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/BRobot).
